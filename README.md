# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a ~burger~ cake logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Before You Begin

* ~Eat-Da-Burger!~ Eat-Cake is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of ~burgers~ cakes they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a ~burger's~ cake's name, your app will display the ~burger~ cake on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each ~burger~ cake in the waiting area also has an ~`Devour it!`~ `Eat Me` button. When the user clicks it, the ~burger~ cake will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every ~burger~ cake in a database, whether devoured or not.
